# README - HBnB Evolution Technical Documentation

## Part 1: Technical Documentation

### Context and Objective
This document serves as the foundation for the development of the HBnB Evolution application. It provides comprehensive technical documentation to understand the overall architecture, business logic, and system interactions.

### Problem Description
The HBnB Evolution application is a simplified AirBnB-like platform that allows users to:
- Manage user accounts (registration, profile updates, role management)
- List and manage properties (places) with details such as name, description, price, and location
- Leave and manage reviews for properties
- Manage amenities associated with properties

## Business Rules and Requirements

### User Entity
- Attributes: first name, last name, email, password
- Users can be administrators (boolean attribute)
- Actions: register, update profile, delete account

### Place Entity
- Attributes: title, description, price, latitude, longitude
- Places are associated with their owner (user)
- Can have a list of amenities
- Actions: create, update, delete, list

### Review Entity
- Attributes: associated place, user, rating, comment
- Actions: create, update, delete, list by place

### Amenity Entity
- Attributes: name, description
- Actions: create, update, delete, list

### General Constraints
- Each object must have a unique ID
- Audit information: creation and update timestamps

## Architecture and Layers
The application follows a layered architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Services and API endpoints for user interaction
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Core models and application logic
3. **Persistence Layer**: Database storage and retrieval

### Persistence
All data is stored in a database (implementation specified in Part 3 of the project).

## Tasks

### 1. High-Level Package Diagram
#### Objective
Illustrate the three-layer architecture and how they interact via the facade pattern.

#### Components
- **Presentation Layer**: Services, API endpoints
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- **Persistence Layer**: Database access objects

#### Deliverables
- **Diagram**: Showing architecture, communication pathways, facade pattern
- **Explanations**: Layer responsibilities, facade pattern benefits

### 2. Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer
#### Objective
Provide a detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer.

#### Key Elements
- **Entities**: User, Place, Review, Amenity
- **Relationships**: Associations, inheritance, compositions
- **Methods and Attributes**

#### Deliverables
- **Diagram**: Class structure, attributes, methods, relationships
- **Explanations**: Entity roles, relationships, design rationale

### 3. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls
#### Objective
Develop sequence diagrams for API calls illustrating system interactions.

#### API Calls
1. User Registration
2. Place Creation
3. Review Submission
4. Fetching a List of Places

#### Deliverables
- **Diagrams**: Four sequence diagrams with clear step-by-step interactions
- **Explanations**: Key steps, system communication flow

### 4. Documentation Compilation
#### Objective
Compile all diagrams and explanatory notes into a cohesive technical document.

#### Structure
1. **Introduction**: Overview, purpose
2. **High-Level Architecture**: Package diagram and explanation
3. **Business Logic Layer**: Class diagram and explanation
4. **API Interaction Flow**: Sequence diagrams and explanation

#### Deliverables
- **Final Technical Document**: Professional, clear, and structured reference for implementation

## Recommendations
- **Start Simple**: Draft diagrams before refining details
- **Use Mermaid.js**: Maintain version control and iterative development
- **Seek Feedback**: Get peer/tutor reviews for clarity and accuracy
- **Document As You Go**: Keep notes on design decisions

---
This README serves as a guide for structuring and executing the technical documentation of the HBnB Evolution project. Ensure all requirements and architectural elements are clearly defined to facilitate seamless implementation.
